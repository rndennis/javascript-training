# Lab 5

## 5.0 - TypeScript Configuration

### Instructions

1. Run `npm i -g typescript` to install TypeScript globally.
2. Run tsc to verify that a js/ directory appears.
3. Similar to before, we'll be running our scripts with npm scripts. However, as we're compiling TypeScript down to JavaScript and are ultimately executing JavaScript, to run a TypeScript file, `[lab number].ts`, we'll need to run `npm start [lab number].js`.
4. For `5.1.js` specifically, it's not a TypeScript file and it does not need to be compiled down to ES5, so we can just run `node 5.1.js`.

## 5.1 - ES6 Classes (again)

### Instructions

1. Open `5.1.js` and complete the first TODO (using ES6 classes).
2. Complete the second TODO and run the project (`node 5.1.js`) to verify your results.

## 5.2 - TypeScript Classes

### Instructions

1. Open `5.2.ts` and complete the first TODO.
2. Notice all of the errors? Hover over them to see what they are.
3. Notice some of the new TypeScript syntax on lines 2 and 5.
4. Fix the rest of the errors and run your script, `npm start 5.2.js`.

### Post-lab Questions

1. What is the difference between statically and dynamically typed languages?
2. How would you categorize JavaScript?
3. Would you prefer to see errors at compile time or runtime?

## 5.3 - TypeScript Interfaces

### Instructions

1. Open `5.3.ts` and complete all of the TODOs.

### Post-lab Questions

1. Where do you think interfaces would prove themselves useful?
