# Lab 0 - Managing Dependencies with npm

### Instructions

1. Open index.html in Chrome - doesn't look like much, does it? Let's add some missing dependencies.
2. Open the integrated terminal in VS Code `` ctrl + ` `` or `View > Integrated Terminal`).
3. Install jQuery and Material Design Lite by running: `npm install --save jquery material-design-lite`.
4. Note that a `node_modules/` directory appears with `jquery` and `material-design-lite` sub-directories.
5. In `index.html`, we need to add `jquery.min.js`, `material.min.js`, and `material.min.css` from our `node_modules/` directory. Complete the TODOs in `index.html` and do that now.
6. Refresh `index.html` in Chrome - looks much nicer now, right?
