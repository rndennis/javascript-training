# Lab 3

## 3.1 - Classes

### Instructions

1. Compare and contrast the function-based (1.2.js) and class-based (3.1.js) Pokedex
2. Complete the first two TODO's
3. Complete the third TODO, run the script, and verify your results
4. Complete the fourth TODO, run the script, and verify your results

### Post-lab Questions

1. Since not all supported browsers support ES6+, you'll often hear a lot about JavaScript transpilers (e.g. Babel) that compiles ES6+ code down to ES5. What do you think the compiled code would look like for this lab? (We'll be going over this as a group, but you can run `npm i` and then `npm run transpile` to generate 3.1.compiled.js)

## 3.2 - Subclasses

### Instructions

1. Notice the use of the `extends` keyword to create a subclass `FirePokemon` of `Pokemon`
2. Complete the TODO, run the script, and verify your results

### Post-lab Questions

1. This isn't a question, but, in contrast to Java, JavaScript isn't actually a _class-based_ language, it's a _prototype-based_ language. The `class` keyword is simply _syntactic sugar_. <sub>[Source](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array)</sub>
2. Would you consider JavaScript an object-oriented programming language?
